## Flashlight for PC Building Simulator
Can't find that damn light switch? Need to brighten up? Like to blind your non-existant customers?
Then this mod is perfect for you, it adds a switchable flashlight to PC Building Simulator that you can turn on and off using the F key!

## Requirements
Requires FusioN.'s modloader for PCBS to be installed ( https://github.com/fusiion/PCBSModloader/releases )

## Installation
Extract the mod folder in the archive to <PCBS folder>\Mods

## Compatibility
Should work with all other mods as long as the PCBS modloader is installed. You should use a clean Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll with only the modloader installed.
Code changes in future versions of PC Building Simulator may break the mod.
