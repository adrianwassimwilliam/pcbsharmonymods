## Inventory Sort Options for PC Building Simulator
This mod gives you a dropdown with several sort options for your inventory. The options are:
Default, Newest First, Price Ascending, Price Descending, Name Ascending and Name Descending.

## Requirements
Requires FusioN.'s modloader for PCBS to be installed ( https://github.com/fusiion/PCBSModloader/releases )

## Installation
Extract everything in the archive to your PCBS folder, overwrite if necessary.

## Compatibility
Should work with all other mods as long as the PCBS modloader is installed. You should use a clean Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll with only the modloader installed.
Code changes in future versions of PC Building Simulator may break the mod.
