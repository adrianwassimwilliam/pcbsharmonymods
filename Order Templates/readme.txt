## Order Templates for PC Building Simulator
Changes the PC Shop (Bits&PCs). Allows you to save your current shopping cart as a template that you can recall later.
Useful for recurring builds where 90% of the parts are the same. Multiple templates are supported.

How to use:
1. Go to your PC and open the Shop app
2. Add the items you wish to have as a template to your shopping cart
3. Go to the shopping cart, scroll down to the part where it says "Order Templates" and enter a template name
4. Click "Save As Template"

For every template there should be 3 buttons: 
	- "Restore" to clear out the current shopping cart and add all the items from the template instead 
	- "Add from" to add the template items to the current shopping cart
	- "Remove" to remove the template

## Installation
Extract the mod folder in the archive to <PCBS folder>\Mods

## Compatibility
Should work with all other mods as long as the PCBS modloader is installed. You should use a clean Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll with only the modloader installed.
Code changes in future versions of PC Building Simulator may break the mod.
