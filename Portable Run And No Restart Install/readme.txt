## Portable Run And No Restart Install for PC Building Simulator
Allows you to run programs directly from the USB stick by providing another tab "Portable".
Also makes installing and uninstalling programs not require a restart anymore, they immediately appear on the desktop/get removed again. 

## Requirements
Requires FusioN.'s modloader for PCBS to be installed.

## Install
1. Extract everything in the archive to the main directory of PC Building Simulator, overwrite if necessary

## Compatibility
Should work with all other mods as long as the PCBS modloader is installed. You should use a clean Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll with only the modloader installed.
Code changes in future versions of PC Building Simulator may break the mod.
