## Prefab Patcher for PC Building Simulator
!!NOT WORKING!!

## Requirements
Requires FusioN.'s modloader for PCBS to be installed.

## Install
1. Extract everything in the archive to the main directory of PC Building Simulator, overwrite if necessary

## Compatibility
Should work with all other mods as long as the PCBS modloader is installed. You should use a clean Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll with only the modloader installed.
Code changes in future versions of PC Building Simulator may break the mod.
