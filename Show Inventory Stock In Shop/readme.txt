## Show Inventory Stock In Shop for PC Building Simulator
Shows how many of an item you already have in your inventory or in your storage/benches (for cases) both in the shop and in the inventory.
Stock display is color coded, default range is 0-10 items where 0 is red and 10 is green, this can be customized in "Show Inventory Stock In Shop.conf" where you can change the number from which on it shows green.

## Requirements
Requires FusioN.'s modloader for PCBS to be installed ( https://github.com/fusiion/PCBSModloader/releases )

## Installation
Extract the mod folder in the archive to <PCBS folder>\Mods

## Compatibility
Should work with all other mods as long as the PCBS modloader is installed. You should use a clean Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll with only the modloader installed.
Code changes in future versions of PC Building Simulator may break the mod.
