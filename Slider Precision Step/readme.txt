## Slider Precision Step for PC Building Simulator
Makes all sliders in the game step by 1 when used with the arrow keys, allowing for precision overclocking in the GPU Tuner app.
Click on the slider to focus it first, then use the left and right arrow keys for setting the precise value.

## Requirements
Requires FusioN.'s modloader for PCBS to be installed ( https://github.com/fusiion/PCBSModloader/releases )

## Installation
Extract the mod folder in the archive to <PCBS folder>\Mods

## Compatibility
Should work with all other mods as long as the PCBS modloader is installed. You should use a clean Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll with only the modloader installed.
Code changes in future versions of PC Building Simulator may break the mod.
