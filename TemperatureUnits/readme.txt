## Temperatures in Fahrenheit 
This changes the various temperatures displayed in-game to fahrenheit instead of celsius in case you simply prefer fahrenheit or if you're more used to it.

## Requirements
Requires FusioN.'s modloader for PCBS to be installed ( https://github.com/fusiion/PCBSModloader/releases )

## Installation
Extract the mod folder in the archive to <PCBS folder>\Mods

## Compatibility
Should work with all other mods as long as the PCBS modloader is installed. You should use a clean Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll with only the modloader installed.
Code changes in future versions of PC Building Simulator may break the mod.
